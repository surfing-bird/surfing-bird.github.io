        <Text>
          Whenever you teleport by any means, you don't require line of sight to
          the target location. Additionally, any ally adjacent to you may use
          Blink as a maneuver with this benefit, but cannot use its spend
          effect.

        <Text>
          When a Runebrand is detonated, it applies its effect to every enemy
          within range 4 of it, instead of within range 3. In addition, your
          Runebrand ability now has a 'Ranged 5' range.

        <Text>
