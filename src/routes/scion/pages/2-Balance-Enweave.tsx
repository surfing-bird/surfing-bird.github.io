      <Heading2>Balance</Heading2>

      <TextBlock>
        <Text>
          You can align movement, feeling, and intent to a single purpose,
          cultivating a heroic resource called Balance.
        </Text>
      </TextBlock>

      <Heading3>Balance in Combat</Heading3>

      <TextBlock>
        <Text>
          At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation
          tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain
          balance equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns
          during combat, you gain 2 balance.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          Additionally, the first time in a combat round that you use an ability
          with a Weapon tag after using an ability with the Magic tag, or vice
          versa, you gain 1 Balance.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          The first time you spend Balance in a combat round, the cost is
          reduced by one.
        </Text>
      </TextBlock>

      <Heading3>Balance Outside of Combat</Heading3>

      <TextBlock>
        <Text>
          Though you can’t gain balance outside of combat, you can use your
          heroic abilities and effects that cost balance without spending it.
          Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs
          balance, you can’t use that same ability or effect outside of combat
          again until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          If you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited
          balance on its effect, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of
          nerve on it equal to your Victories.
        </Text>
      </TextBlock>

      <Heading2>Kit</Heading2>
      <Text>
        You can use and gain the benefits of a kit. See Chapter 6: Kits for more
        information.

              The chosen effect applies to your next melee weapon ability. It
              may change its damage type. Any additional effects are applied
              after the ability is resolved, and if the ability has multiple
              targets - apply the effect to one target of your choosing. If you
              use this ability more than once before an ability, choose one of
              the damage types to change your next ability's type to, but apply
              all of the additional effects. You cannot use this ability more
              than twice before benefiting from its effect.
