      <Title>The Scion</Title>

      <TextBlock>
        <Text>
          You were deemed worthy of a secret Art unknown to most, allowing you
          to weave steel and magic into a single, fluid dance. Passed down
          through an unbroken chain of master and disciple, this ancient
          discipline was entrusted to you, its esoteric techniques guiding you
          toward the cultivation of Balance: a harmonious alignment of movement,
          feeling, and intent.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          As a Scion, you move with purpose - each strike empowered to suit the
          moment, whether to wound, disrupt, or disable, your flexibility is
          unmatched. At the height of your mastery, you are the eye of the
          storm: utterly calm, yet entirely devastating.

      <Heading3>Art</Heading3>
      <TextBlock>
        <Text>
          Each Scion is a single, carefully chosen inheritor of a different Art.
          The masters of each Art hold different ideals, and choose their scions
          according to their adherence to these ideals - and their capability to
          uphold them.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          You were trained in an Art chosen from the following options, each of
          which grants you a skill.

      <Heading3>Blinkblade</Heading3>
      <TextBlock>
        <Text>
          The Blinkblade is a master of teleportation magic, using it to blink
          in and out of reach with uncanny speed - difficult to catch, and
          harder still to escape. You gain the Gymnastics skill.

      </TextBlock>
      <Heading3>Runewright</Heading3>
      <TextBlock>
        <Text>
          The Runewright wields the ancient craft of runebranding to sear
          volatile runes onto living beings and shape the battlefield through
          groundlaid writs. You gain the Mechanics skill.
        </Text>

        <Text className="italic">
          Knowledge is power. I carve order out of chaos.

      <Heading3>Soulforged</Heading3>
      <TextBlock>
        <Text>
          The Soulforged binds a fragment of their soul into a chosen weapon,
          forging a sentient extension of their will - a Soulblade. Through this
          bond, they shape and empower their blade, adapting its form and
          function to meet the shifting demands of battle. You gain the
          Empathize skill.
        </Text>

        <Text className="italic !font-cinzel-decorative">
          I am the soul of my blade. I bring justice for all.

      <Heading3>Darksworn</Heading3>
      <TextBlock>
        <Text>
          The Darksworn embraces forbidden power - blood magic, curses, and the
          power of pain. They bleed so their foes may suffer, sacrificing
          vitality to bring ruin to all those who stand in their way. You gain
          the Intimidate skill.
        </Text>

        <Text className="italic">
          Pain is a weapon. I will stop at nothing.
