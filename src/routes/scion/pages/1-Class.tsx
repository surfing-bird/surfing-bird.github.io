      <TextBlock>
        <Text>
          You were deemed worthy of a secret Art unknown to most, allowing you
          to weave steel and magic into a single, fluid dance. Passed down
          through an unbroken chain of master and disciple, this ancient
          discipline was entrusted to you, its esoteric techniques guiding you
          toward the cultivation of Balance: a harmonious alignment of movement,
          feeling, and intent.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          As a Scion, you move with purpose - each strike empowered to suit the
          moment, whether to wound, disrupt, or disable, your flexibility is
          unmatched. At the height of your mastery, you are the eye of the
          storm: utterly calm, yet entirely devastating.

          The Blinkblade is a master of teleportation magic, using it to blink
          in and out of reach with uncanny speed - difficult to catch, and
          harder still to escape. You gain the Escape Artist skill.

          function to meet the shifting demands of battle. You gain the
          Empathize skill.

      <Heading2>Balance</Heading2>

      <TextBlock>
        <Text>
          You can align movement, feeling, and intent to a single purpose,
          cultivating a heroic resource called Balance.
        </Text>
      </TextBlock>

      <Heading3>Balance in Combat</Heading3>

      <TextBlock>
        <Text>
          At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation
          tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain
          balance equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns
          during combat, you gain 2 balance.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          Additionally, the first time in a combat round that you use an ability
          with a Weapon tag after using an ability with the Magic tag, or vice
          versa, you gain 1 Balance.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          The first time you spend Balance in a combat round, the cost is
          reduced by one.
        </Text>
      </TextBlock>

      <Heading3>Balance Outside of Combat</Heading3>

      <TextBlock>
        <Text>
          Though you can’t gain balance outside of combat, you can use your
          heroic abilities and effects that cost balance without spending it.
          Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs
          balance, you can’t use that same ability or effect outside of combat
          again until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          If you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited
          balance on its effect, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of
          nerve on it equal to your Victories.
        </Text>
      </TextBlock>

      <Heading2>Enweave</Heading2>
      <Text>
        Your mastery of Balance allows you to channel magic through your weapon.

              The chosen effect applies to your next strike. It may change your

              after the strike is resolved, and to one target of your choosing.
              If you use this ability more than once before a strike, choose one
              of the damage types to change your next strike’s type to, but
              apply all of the additional effects. You cannot use this ability
              more than twice before making a strike.
