      <Feature title="Afterimage">
        <Text>
          Whenever you teleport by any means, you leave a distracting afterimage
          in your previous location until the end of your next turn. Power rolls
          targeting enemies adjacent to an afterimage gain edge. The afterimage
          does not occupy space and cannot be targeted or destroyed.
        </Text>
      </Feature>

      <Feature title="Liminal Runes">
        <Text>
          An enemy with a branded rune receives a bane on their power rolls as
          long as the rune remains undetonated. An ally or yourself with a
          branded rune gains an edge on their power rolls as long as the rune
          remains undetonated.
        </Text>
      </Feature>

      <Feature title="Soul Instinct">
        <Text>
          Once per turn, you can make an opportunity attack whenever a creature
          moves from a square adjacent to you to another square adjacent to you.
          In addition, your stability is increased by 1.
        </Text>
      </Feature>

      <Feature title="Ne Obliviscaris">
        <Text>
          Whenever you deal damage to a creature who has dealt damage to you
          since the end of your last turn, you deal extra damage equal to your
          Reason score.
